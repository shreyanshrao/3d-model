Firsty i  install all the libraries needed and try  to run them in the python file to see if they are successfully installed.
then try to use my api key from meshy.ai which is an open library that helps to create 3d models from the text and images.
how should i see my model for eg their quality and size anter this into the code
after this enter the prompt which the meshy.ai helps in generating the model and the return id is save into the link2.txt
meshy.ai takes around 1 min to generate the model so i paused the program for 55 sec 

 After the process is completed it will save the .obj file and a video preveiw of the model in the same file
